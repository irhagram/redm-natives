# redm-natives
all natives in lua

## how to use?
make the native.lua as a shared script, and just call the native without invokenative, so just like develop fivem server.

if you are using ox_lib, i recommend you to use reqnative.lua and put require function to your script, it is more better, because there is some native that could not be called by invokenative (maybe)
